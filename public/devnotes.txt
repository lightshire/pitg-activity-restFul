##NOTES##
	1. Developers should always encapsulate incoming requests
	2. Eager-loading is a must
	3. in creating database tables DO NOT FORGET to add a column "slug" - if there's a column title, name or anything that 
		distingues ownership of a context. Also - in saving, the developer should run Str::slug() on the slug before saving.
	4. in creating database tables DO NOT FORGET to add $table->timestamps()  - we may need it in the future
	5. always do a migrate:rollback and always do a db:seed, when the devnote tells you too.
	6. regarding Relational Models on Backbone - check http://backbonerelational.org/
	
	TODO:
	1.	 fix the API class to have a better and more fluid class system. The class system right now is to static for a developer (~printf)
	2.	further research soft-delete ~printf
	



##BUGS##
	1. click #/users/all -> then click a user -> then go back to users/all - there's an uncaught error, due to a problem with my initial coding still looking for the cause of the bug

6/11/2013 3:49PM PrintF:
	- for fun  - made all controllers to be used to have a .php after it - so noobs think we dont have a framework - what you think guys?
	- added data-retrieval for backbone relational on User.
	- follow backbone-relational conventions to be able to easily fetch all data (don't forget to eager load)

	##NOTES##
	- please follow the plural-singular conventions on database - model naming.
	  e.g. table: Users - Model: "User"
	- do not override the protected $table - eloquent should be able to fetch it properly
	- table names in unix environment are case-sensitive thus - Category != category

	-saving already on the process
	##NOTES##
	- check events
	- added profile api

	- added serializeToObject() c/o stackoverflow - this is needed to easily set a form into a JSON - we need to set the data into json so that backbone can render it and save it to the db
	- user profile is already saving
	- added security on storing data - ProfileApiController
	- added profile alert when being saved
	- added jquery.iframe.transport.js - used for "tweaking" ajax upload


6/12/2013 Printf:
	- added "!" route, why? because i love it thats why
	- you may comment regarding the matter - the only use of this is to be able to look cool when backbone.js is added
	- head template for front end is already being customized
	- check /!/login to see edits

	##NOTE - IMPORTANT##
	- bug fixed
	- UserView.js goto line: 38, all instantiation of any models that extend backbone-relational
	- should use findOrCreate - user should not use new User() but User.findOrCreate

	- added initializr html5 boilerplate w/ twitterbootstrap
	- initializr folder - contains the latest html5boilerplate w/ bootstrap - you may use it if you want
	- templates have been updated
