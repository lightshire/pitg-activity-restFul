This is the activity site for Pinoy IT Geeks. This website is in full development procedure. Also, this website has no current host

To be able to run this code you should do the following:

```PHP
php composer.phar install
php composer.phar update
php artisan migrate:install // if not yet migrated
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```
